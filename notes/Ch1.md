# Ch. 1 - Introduction

### 1.1 - Why learn this stuff?

* Although the most widely-used languages are few in number, there are many more "little languages" that have niche uses, such as:
  * Application scripting languages
  * Template engines
  * Markup formats
  * Configuration files
* Writing a language is tough, the code is complex and performance critical
* Going through this process can help you master important coding concepts such as:
  * Recursion
  * Dynamic arrays
  * Trees
  * Graphs
  * Hash tables

### 1.2 - How the Book is Organized

* The book is devided into 3 parts:
  * An introduction, including to Lox, the language we'll be implementing
  * An implementation of Lox in Java
  * An implementation of Lox in C
* The book will show all the code being implemented

### 1.3 - The First Interpreter
* We will use Java to implement the first version of Lox as it's an OOP language
* Java also has static types so you know what's going on under the hood
* C# and C++ can also be used to similar effect
* This interpreter will be correct, but it will be slow as well

### 1.4 - The Second Interpreter

* We will finally use C to implement the final version of Lox
* This interpreter will be correct *and* fast
